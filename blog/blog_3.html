        <h1>Japanese Pancakes</h1>
        <p><strong>I MADE FLUFFY PANCAKES!! I MADE FLUFFY JAPANESE PANCAKES!! </strong></p>
        <p>Sorry for shouting, but I’m so excited!! Ever since the first time I laid eyes on those giggly giant fluffy Japanese pancakes, I’ve been obsessed. We may or may not have been to <em>almost</em> every fluffy pancake place in Tokyo because of my obsession – <a href="https://iamafoodblog.com/tokyo-food-guide-where-to-eat-fluffy-japanese-pancakes-in-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s a run down</a> on the places we’ve been to. I love the way Japanese pancakes taste: light, airy, and oh so delicious.</p>
        <p>The best part of going to the pancake places, aside from eating the pancakes, is that you get to watch them expertly shape, flip, and plate up serving after serving of fluffy goodness. It’s nice to watch but also kind of awkward because I’m sure the pancake peeps don’t really want anyone staring at them. I would have major anxiety if people were watching me do my job day after day after day.</p>
        <p>Heck, I was anxious making these pancakes in the safety of my own home in my joggers and sweatshirt. It’s a good thing I was in comfy clothes because these pancakes have been years in the making and to be honest, I failed a couple times before they came out just the way I wanted them.</p>
        <img src="https://iamafoodblog.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/japanese-fluffy-pancakes-recipe-7066-2.jpg" width="500px" class="rounded d-block mx-auto">
        <h2>Japanese pancakes: with or without mold?</h2>
<p>The very first time I tried to do Japanese pancakes I did the ring mold version, but that just wasn&#8217;t what I wanted. Then, a couple of years ago, I winged it and made some that tasted good, but weren&#8217;t perfect, looks wise. (Update: I made the ones with molds and they are <a href="https://iamafoodblog.com/how-to-make-extra-tall-extra-fluffy-japanese-souffle-pancakes-like-gram-cafe-and-pancakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super tall and fluffy</a>!) I kept meaning to perfect that recipe and put it up, but I kind of sort of *gasp* forgot about them. Just recently though, Mike mentioned that Pancake Day was coming up and I started thinking about pancakes again and here we are.</p>
<p>I tried to find the recipe that I was working on so many years ago but somehow it was gone so I gave up and just tried out a very popular google result. Sadly, I was seriously disappointed: too eggy and nothing like <a href="https://iamafoodblog.com/tokyo-food-guide-where-to-eat-fluffy-japanese-pancakes-in-tokyo/">the pancakes I&#8217;ve had in Tokyo</a>. They weren&#8217;t even fluffy?! I just knew I had to get back the recipe that I started so many years ago so I asked Mike to help and lo and behold, it was there, on my computer. With tasty recipe in hand, I set out on making them even fluffier and went deep into fluffy pancake search mode and found a promising looking video.</p>
<p><img class="rounded d-block mx-auto" src="https://iamafoodblog.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/japanese-fluffy-pancakes-recipe-7060.jpg" alt="fluffy japanese pancakes | www.iamafoodblog.com" width="500px"/>
<h2 class="pullquote">I set out on making them even fluffier and went deep into fluffy pancake search mode&#8230;</h2>
<p>The recipe in the video is pretty much like mine, with just a few changes: I stabilized the egg whites with a bit of cream of tartar, decreased the baking powder, took out the vanilla and salt, and increased the sugar and cooking time. I guess when I put it like that, I changed the recipe quite a lot. I was super happy with the results: the pancakes came out super fluffy and tasted almost just like what I remember!</p>
<p>There are two key things you need to concentrate on if you want to make fluffy pancakes at home. One is the meringue – be sure that it&#8217;s well developed but not over beaten. The second one is how you cook them. Most of the recipes I see online use either frying pans on low heat or the exact same machines that they use in Japan: flat griddles with giant lids.</p>
<p>My first couple of attempts were with a frying pan with a lid. These didn&#8217;t work out for me – the heat of my gas stove, even on low, was too high. I don&#8217;t have one of those fun griddles (even though I want one) so I went with what I found at home: <a href="https://amzn.to/3j6hms7">my crepe pan</a>! It has a super low setting that worked perfectly. I don&#8217;t have a lid for it but my giant wok lid worked in a pinch. <strong>Fluffy pancake success!</strong> Serve them up with a dusting of icing sugar, whipped butter and maple syrup. You&#8217;ll be in heaven.</p>

<h2>What is a Japanese soufflé pancake?</h2>
<p>A Japanese soufflé pancake is a pancake made using soufflé techniques. Egg whites are whipped up with sugar into a glossy thick meringue then mixed with a batter made with the yolks. Soufflé pancakes are incredibly popular in Japan.</p>
<p>Soufflé pancakes are fluffy, jiggly, sweet, soft, and so, so delicious. They taste like you are eating a sweet pancake cloud, with butter and syrup!</p>
<h2>Soufflé pancake ingredients</h2>
<p>You only need six ingredients to make soufflé pancakes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eggs.</strong> Eggs make up the bulk of the pancakes. It’s best to use room temp eggs.</li>
<li><strong>Sugar.</strong> Sugar adds sweetness. If you don’t want to use sugar and make keto soufflé pancakes, you can substitute in something like Swerve for a sugar-free alternative.</li>
<li><strong>Milk.</strong> Milk helps smooth out the pancake batter.</li>
<li><strong>Flour.</strong> You need just the tiniest amount of flour to help your pancakes hold their shape. If you want to make keto soufflé pancakes, use superfine almond flour.</li>
<li><strong>Baking powder.</strong> Baking powder is what makes the pancakes rise tall and fluffy.</li>
<li><strong>Cream of tartar.</strong> Cream of tartar is a stabilizer that will help your egg whites whip up to their potential. Stable fluffy egg whites are the key to successfully making soufflé pancakes. If you don’t have cream of tartar, you can sub in 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice.</li>
</ol>
